<h1>BEST ANIMES ACCORDING TO DEBASHRITA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite animes</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Death Note</h3>
<p>This was the first anime I watched. It requires a lot of brainstorming has amazing storyline.</p>
<h3>2. Attack on Titan </h3>
<p> AOT has the biggest plot twists. You bond with the characters so well and by the end the show will leave it upto you to differentiate between right and wrong and who's side are you on.</p>
<h3>3. Black Clover</h3>
<p>It has some amazing character development. It showcases no matter how low you start from anyone can reach the top if you are actually dedicated.</p>
